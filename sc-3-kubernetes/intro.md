# Introduction

In the last scenario, we built a docker image of our game server and deployed it as a container. 
Now, our code is ready to be deployed to any machine. 
In this scenario, we will go through common Kubernetes resources and learn how we can manage the deployment of our code across different machines.


This scenario comes in the following configuration: 

1. You are given a Kubernetes cluster of two nodes. 
2. Each node is a Linux machine that can run your docker containers.
