# Docker Basics

### Understand the docker run command

When we ran the `docker run` command, the following happens: 

1. Docker checks the system for the `docker/welcome-to-docker` image
2. If the image does not exist on the system, it fetches it for you
3. Then, using the image, it creates and runs the container with name `hello-world`
