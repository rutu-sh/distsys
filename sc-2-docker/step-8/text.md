# Docker Basics

### Let's build a Docker image for our Python server

Recall the steps we performed to run the Python server before: 

1. Download the source code 
2. Install virtual environment support for Python
3. Create virtual environment
4. Activate virtual environment
5. Install the required packages
6. Run the game server


We are going to build a Docker image that takes care of all these steps for us.
