# Docker Basics

### Let's build a Docker image for our Python server

Recall the steps we performed to run the Python server before: 

1. Download the source code 
2. Install virtual environment support for Python
3. Create virtual environment
4. Activate virtual environment
5. Install the required packages
6. Run the game server


On top of that, we built and ran our server on the following configuration: 

1. A linux system
2. Python3 version 3.12.3
3. Python3 requirements (`flask==3.1.2` and `gunicorn==23.0.0`)
